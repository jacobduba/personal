                I am a lazy programmer... I write plain code because I won't understand it in six months otherwise. Then
                I automate testing so I don't have to manually regression test the code every release. Finally since I
                don't want to memorize a complex deployment I automate the deployment.I am a lazy programmer... I write

                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists on
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navitation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>OSS Contributions</h3>
                <p>I have contributed to several open source projects in the past year. I added a new keyboard shortcut
                    to the GNOME Terminal emulator to zoom in and out of the terminal window using the Ctrl + Scroll
                    wheel keys. I improved the performance of the AWS Lambda Builders by preventing them from cloning
                    the TypeScript source code to a scratch directory before compiling it. I fixed a regression in the
                    Miniflux RSS reader that caused it to reset the touch-item state of unread articles even if the user
                    was not viewing the unread articles list. I also prevented the Miniflux RSS reader from resetting
                    the touch-item state of articles that have been successfully swiped away.</p>
